# NBody-Simulation

This repository contains all the Java code needed to create a basic N-Body Simulation. An N-Body Simulation is a simulation of a system of particles under the influence of physical properties, such as the force of gravity. The code here can be used to create a simple N-Body Simulation that mimics the movements of the planets around the Sun in our Solar System.
